# CHRP3andUBMP-RemoteControlBot

This was a grade 10 summative project for TEJ2OI. The goal was to have one board send IR Codes, and the other do actions based on the code received. The tranmission protocol is based off the [SONY SIRC Protocol].


## CHRP3 Project

This program is for receiving IR signals and processing them. The motors will then switch on/off depending on the values of the IR signal received, effectively moving the robot.

## UBMP Project
A program to send IR codes to the CHRP3 board.
